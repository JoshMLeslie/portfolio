Sketch out different components for industrial / web side. Probably only change the home screen and keep the resume + about sections the same?

Probably make a reusable 'project' component for more in-depth detail - sketch out.

### Web:
#### Finish building out the repo component
    plug REPO-GET into the component

    style component to load repos into a nice column thing with a 'loading' spinner for each?
        fuckin cdk scroll not supporting multi-column
            tried using flex-wrapping before, but it just freaks out.
            maybe dig into cdk scroll source to see how they stagger HTML rendering

    add component to web-home screen

### Industrial:
find old ID stuff - see if pulling them from Gdrive works, maybe host it on AWS for kicks.
